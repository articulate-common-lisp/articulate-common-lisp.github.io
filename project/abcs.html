<h1 class="title">ABCs of Lisp</h1>
</header>
<p>This file summarizes a few of the key concepts of working with Common Lisp and some common nomenclature. It also gives you a quick and easy set of &#8220;template&#8221; copy and paste forms for early use.</p>
<h2 id="concepts-and-comments">Concepts and Comments</h2>
<p>Common Lisp (let&#8217;s just call it Lisp for the rest of the file) is designed around the idea of having a <em>REPL</em> (read evaluate print loop).</p>
<p>Typically, what occurs is the Lisper injects <em>forms</em> (the text between parentheses) from the editor into the REPL directly. E.g., in the author&#8217;s emacs configuration, <code>C-x e</code> evaluates the text in the buffer in the operating Lisp instance, immediately available for inspection and testing. This is in strong contrast to languages like C where a recompile of the project/file is required to check correctness of the code.</p>
<p>It is also feasible to develop in a more traditional style, where there is an edit/compile/revise cycle based upon files. In order to do that, use the LOAD form from the repl or the particular system&#8217;s automatic load command-line option. <code>(LOAD &quot;lispfile.lisp&quot;)</code>.</p>
<p>Modern Lisp systems commonly provide on-the-fly compilation of the forms entered into it. This will slow down the boot process if the compilation happens every time; interpreted programs will run slower but boot faster. One common deployment strategy involves saving a preloaded <em>image</em> and executing it on demand.</p>
<p>Most Lisp work is done within the Emacs/SLIME milieu; however, IDE&#8217;s like LispWorks or Allegro Common Lisp offer similar functionality.</p>
<p>Typically the Lisp forms such as <code>LET</code>, <code>DEFUN</code>, and <code>MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND</code> contain something known as an &#8220;implicit progn&#8221;. The implicit progn denotes a list of commands in a block structure (see <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw61/CLHS/Body/s_progn.htm">PROGN</a> for details). However, <code>IF</code> does not have this, which routinely is a gotcha to the author.</p>
<p>Common Lisp contains a macro facility - <code>DEFMACRO</code>. Generally, newbies are not advised to write their own macros, as they are powerful and can cause unexpected results.</p>
<p>When setting a variable, use SETF, not SETQ or SET. Those commands operate at a lower level of abstraction and are not designed for everyday use.</p>

<h2 id="standard-packages.">Standard packages.</h2>

<p>Some of these packages are community-recognized standards; others are simply the best the author has found. All are available on Quicklisp.</p>
