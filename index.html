<h2 id="dear-reader">Dear Reader,</h2>
  <h3> and welcome, hacker news readers!</h3>
<p>One of the key problems in onboarding developers to use modern Common Lisp is the vertical wall of difficulty. Things that are routinely problematic:</p>
<ul>
  <li>emacs use. Most people don&#8217;t use emacs.</li>
  <li>Library creation. Putting together ASDF libraries and using them is a fairly horrid experience the first time.</li>
  <li>Selection of Lisp implementation to use, along with an up-to-date discussion of pros and cons.</li>
  <li>Putting together serious projects is not commonly discussed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This site is dedicated to handling these problems. My goal is to put together an introduction/tutorial for practicing professionals and hobbyists from other languages. People who want to get started with Lisp beyond just typing into a REPL. Right now, it feels like this information is less disseminated and much less centralized than it otherwise might be. It&#8217;s not intended to be a HOWTO for Common Lisp. That&#8217;s been covered <em>quite well</em>. But it is intended to be a HOWTO on how to put together a Lisp <strong>environment</strong>.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;d like to collaborate with other people to make this a remarkably fine Lisp help site. Contributions are both <strong>accepted</strong> and <strong>welcome</strong>. It&#8217;s a wholly static site at this point in time - I don&#8217;t see a need for articulate-lisp.com to have a dynamic backend. Perhaps/probably one of the code examples will be a webapp.</p>
<p>Happy Hacking,</p>
