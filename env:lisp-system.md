% Choosing Your Lisp

Common Lisp implementations usually are called "systems", and there
are a number for the expert to choose from; this author will make
recommendations for the novice.

Open Source
---

In general, Lisp systems are designed around a front end to do
development with.  However, without an IDE, usually the best usability
is to use a system with working arrow keys in the terminal. The author
has investigated the *CCL* and *SBCL* systems using a plugin called
Linedit; this should provide a ramp-up experience.

Using emacs as an IDE and [SBCL](http://sbcl.org) (Steel Bank Common
Lisp) is the most popular choice at this point in time for open source
development. Other common systems are CCL (Clozure Common Lisp),
CLISP, ABCL (Armed Bear Common Lisp) and ECL (Embeddable Common
Lisp). Less common systems exist. This author recommends _SBCL_ or
_CCL_ for beginners who are comfortable on the command line, but would
like to point out that each Lisp system provides value within the
general Common Lisp ecosystem.


Commercial
---

LispWorks and Allegro are the currently maintained commercial
implementations (as well as IDEs). They provide free
limited-functionality personal editions with an IDE. This author has
had good experiences with LispWorks.
