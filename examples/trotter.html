<h1 class="title">Trotter Walkthrough</h1>
</header>
<p>The Trotter is an example web spider; it &#8220;trots&#8221; through a web page, heuristically determining which links to follow and recursively printing them.</p>
<p>The Trotter is designed to be a simple program to demonstrate what a basic Common Lisp program looks like.</p>
<p>The raw file can be found at <a href="src/web-trotter.lisp">web-trotter.lisp</a>.</p>
<p>The first form in the code is loading the external libraries:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode commonlisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp">(ql:quickload &#39;(:drakma
                :split-sequence
                :cl-ppcre
                :babel))</code></pre>
<p><code>DRAKMA</code> is the standard HTTP(S) client library in Lisp, <code>SPLIT-SEQUENCE</code> does what you might think, <code>CL-PPCRE</code> is a reimplementation of the PPCRE library in native Lisp (It&#8217;s considered one of the best modern CL libraries, go check the source out sometime). <code>BABEL</code> is a encoding/decoding tool for strings. Note that they are referred to here as &#8220;keywords&#8221;.</p>
<p>The second form in the code defines a global that describes what an URL looks like. Of course, it&#8217;s not very precise, but it suffices for our purpose. The key thing here is that <code>\</code> are doubled for the special forms. This is part of the CL-PPCRE regex definition.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode commonlisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp">(defparameter *url-regex* &quot;(\\w+://[-\\w\\./_?=%&amp;]+)&quot;
  &quot;Hacked up regex suitable for demo purposes.&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Next, a predicate for HTTP. We really don&#8217;t care about FTP, HTTPS, GOPHER, GIT, etc protocols. It returns nil if it can&#8217;t find http:// in the URL.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode commonlisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp">(defun http-p (url)
  (cl-ppcre:all-matches &quot;\\bhttp://&quot; url))</code></pre>
<p>Next, a predicate to check to see if our data is ASCII. While Common Lisp can handle Unicode data, this is a sample program, and the complexities of Unicode can be deferred.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode commonlisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp">(defun ascii-p (data)
  &quot;A not terribly great way to determine if the data is ASCII&quot;
  (unless (stringp data)
    (loop for elem across data do
         (when (&gt; elem 127)
           (return-from ascii-p nil))))
  t)</code></pre>
<p>Next, we have a quick (and dirty) way to see if a URL is going to point to a binary. It just looks for a binary file extension in the string.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode commonlisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp">(defun known-binary-p (url)
    &quot;Is this url a binary file?&quot;
    (let ((binaries
              &#39;(&quot;.png&quot; &quot;.bmp&quot; &quot;.jpg&quot; &quot;.exe&quot; &quot;.dmg&quot; &quot;.package&quot; &quot;.css&quot;
                   &quot;.ico&quot; &quot;.gif&quot; &quot;.dtd&quot; &quot;.pdf&quot; &quot;.xml&quot; &quot;.tgz&quot;)))
        (dolist (b binaries NIL)
            (when (search b url)
                (return T)))))</code></pre>
<p>The next form is the most complex: <code>find-links</code>.</p>
<p><code>find-links</code> attempts to find all the links in a given url.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode commonlisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp">
(defun find-links (url)
  &quot;Scrapes links from a URL. Prints to STDOUT if an error is caught&quot;
  (when (and (http-p url)
             (not (known-binary-p url)))
    (handler-case
        (let ((page (drakma:http-request url)))
          (when page
            (when (ascii-p page)
              (cl-ppcre:all-matches-as-strings
               *url-regex*
               (if (stringp page)
                   page
                   (babel:octets-to-string page))))))

      #+sbcl(sb-int:simple-stream-error (se) (format t &quot;Whoops, ~a didn&#39;t work. ~a~%&quot; url se))
      (DRAKMA::DRAKMA-SIMPLE-ERROR (se) (format t &quot;Error? ~a threw ~a~%&quot; url se))
      (USOCKET:TIMEOUT-ERROR (se) (format t &quot;timeout error ~a threw ~a~%&quot; url se))
      (USOCKET:NS-HOST-NOT-FOUND-ERROR (se) (format t &quot;host-not-found error ~a threw ~a~%&quot; url se))
      (FLEXI-STREAMS:EXTERNAL-FORMAT-ENCODING-ERROR (se) (format t &quot;~a threw ~a~%&quot; url se)))))</code></pre>
<p>The initial form is <code>WHEN</code> - a one-branch conditional. When we have a http link and it&#8217;s not a binary URL, then&#8230;</p>
<p><code>HANDLER-CASE</code> wraps some code. <code>HANDLER-CASE</code> is part of the Common Lisp condition system; it serves as the &#8220;try&#8221; block in this situation. The list of errors below form the &#8220;catch&#8221; blocks. The interested reader is referred to <a href="../quicklinks.html">the quicklinks section</a> for more resources. Note that the errors are typical network errors- timeouts, stream errors, encoding errors.</p>
<p>The first form in <code>HANDLER-CASE</code> requests in the url and assigns it to page. Supposing we got something, we make sure it&#8217;s an ascii page; if so, we then find all the url-ish looking things, using the previously defined global. Supposing that the page is, indeed, a string, we return it, otherwise we convert the octets to a string and return that. N.b.: Common Lisp makes a difference between strings and vectors of bytes. Of course, if an error occurred, the <code>HANDLER-CASE</code> will route to the known conditions.</p>
<p>Note that in one case, <code>#+sbcl</code> is present; this is a Common Lisp syntax to indicate that the following form is for SBCL only.</p>
